Social Media Follower Game

Welcome to the Social Media Follower Game! This Python script allows you to
test your knowledge of social media followers. You will be presented with two accounts, 
and your task is to guess which account has more followers.

How to Play:

When you run the script, you will see the logo and your current score.
You will be shown two accounts, labeled as 'A' and 'B,' along with their names, 
descriptions, and countries.
To make your guess, type 'A' or 'B' and press Enter.
The script will reveal which account has more followers, and if your guess
is correct, your score will increase.
You can continue playing as long as you want. To exit the game, simply make an incorrect 
guess, and your final score will be displayed.

Code Structure

The code is organized as follows:
It imports necessary modules, including ASCII art for the game logo and comparison.
Initializes the score and sets up a loop for the game.
Randomly selects two social media accounts from the provided data and presents them for comparison.
Allows you to input your guess and checks if it's correct.
Updates the score accordingly and continues with the next round or ends 
the game if you make an incorrect guess.
